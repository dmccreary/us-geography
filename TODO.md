## p5.js 2.x Upgrade: MicroSim Fixes Needed (2026-09-05)

A static scan of this repo's `docs/sims/` MicroSims found **2 sim(s)** using p5.js v1-only APIs that will break if upgraded to p5.js 2.x (the microsim-generator skill's templates now default to p5@2.3.2). Fix these before bumping this repo's MicroSims past p5@1.x.

- [ ] **contour-lines** (`docs/sims/contour-lines/`)
    - `script.js` uses `curveVertex(...)`, renamed to `splineVertex()` in v2 with changed anchor-point rules — rename to `splineVertex()`; drop the old duplicated first/last anchor points and rely on `endShape(CLOSE)` for a smooth closed loop.
- [ ] **landform-comparison** (`docs/sims/landform-comparison/`)
    - `script.js` uses the old multi-control-point `bezierVertex(...)` call — v2 takes one control point per `bezierVertex()` call — chain multiple calls instead of packing several points into one; use `bezierOrder()` for a quadratic curve.
