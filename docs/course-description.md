## Interactive Intelligent Geography: The United States 🌎🇺🇸

**Interactive Intelligent Geography: The United States** is a grade-school geography course delivered as an *interactive intelligent textbook*. Instead of passively reading maps, students **explore**, **click**, **zoom**, **compare**, and **play** with rich interactive maps and visual simulations that bring the United States to life.

Students learn all **50 states**—their locations, capitals, symbols, landscapes, climates, and cultures—while also discovering how states connect into larger **regions** such as the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, the Southeast, and innovation hubs like Silicon Valley.

The textbook adapts to student curiosity and pace, offering instant feedback, hints, layered map views, and exploratory challenges. Learners can toggle between political, physical, economic, and cultural maps, helping them see how geography shapes how people live, work, and play across the country.
