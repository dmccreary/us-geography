## 5th Grade Readability Adaptations

The following adaptations were made for 5th-grade reading level:

1. **Simple vocabulary** - Used common words instead of technical jargon
2. **Short sentences** - Kept definitions to 1-2 sentences
3. **Concrete examples** - Every term includes a real-world example students can relate to
4. **Active voice** - Used direct, active language throughout
5. **Familiar comparisons** - Compared unfamiliar concepts to things students know
6. **Avoided abstract language** - Made definitions concrete and visual

## Example Quality Samples

### Excellent Definitions (Score: 95+)

**Mississippi River**
> "The second longest river in North America, flowing from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico."
> **Example:** The Mississippi River is so important that it's sometimes called "America's River."

- Precise: Accurately describes the river
- Concise: 15 words
- Distinctive: No confusion with other rivers
- Non-circular: Uses simpler terms (river, North America)

**Latitude**
> "Imaginary lines that run east and west around Earth, measuring distance north or south of the equator."
> **Example:** The equator is at 0 degrees latitude, and Minnesota is around 45 degrees north latitude.

- Precise: Correctly explains the concept
- Concise: 17 words
- Distinctive: Clearly different from longitude
- Non-circular: Does not use the term being defined

### State Definitions

All 50 state definitions follow a consistent pattern:
1. Geographic region
2. 1-2 key characteristics
3. Example with a memorable fact
