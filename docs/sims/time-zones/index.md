## About This MicroSim

This interactive map helps students learn about US time zones by exploring:

- The four continental time zones (Eastern, Central, Mountain, Pacific)
- How time differs between zones
- Which states are in each time zone
- Major cities in each zone

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over any state to see its time zone
2. Use the **time slider** to change Eastern Time and watch all clocks update
3. Observe how time is **3 hours different** between East and West coasts
4. Click **Quiz Me!** to test your knowledge
5. Notice how the clocks show the same time offset regardless of what hour you set

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Time Zones**: The US spans 4 time zones because of its east-west width
- **Time Offset**: Pacific is 3 hours behind Eastern, Mountain is 2 hours behind, Central is 1 hour behind
- **Practical Application**: When it's noon in New York, it's 9 AM in Los Angeles

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will identify US time zones and calculate time differences between locations.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level:** Apply (L3)

**Activities:**

1. **Explore Mode (5 min)**: Move the slider and observe how all clocks change together but maintain their offsets
2. **State Identification (5 min)**: Hover over states to learn which zone each is in
3. **Quiz Challenge (10 min)**: Complete the 6-question quiz about time zone calculations
4. **Real-World Connection (5 min)**: Discuss when time zones matter (calling family, watching live TV, travel)

**Assessment:** Students should correctly calculate times across zones (e.g., "If it's 2 PM in Chicago, what time is it in Seattle?")
