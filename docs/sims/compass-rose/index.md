## About This MicroSim

This interactive compass rose helps students learn cardinal directions (North, South, East, West) and intermediate directions (Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest). The simulation includes two modes:

**Explore Mode**: Click any direction on the compass rose to learn about it and see its associated landmark.

**Quiz Mode**: An arrow points to a direction - click the correct direction label to earn points!

### Visual Elements

- Large compass rose with 8 labeled points
- North arrow highlighted in red for easy identification
- Surrounding landmarks: Mountain (N), Ocean (E), Desert (S), Forest (W), and more
- Interactive highlighting when directions are selected

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Explore Button | Switch to explore mode - click directions to learn |
| Quiz Button | Switch to quiz mode - test your knowledge |
| Score Display | Shows correct answers out of total attempts |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. **Identify** all eight compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
2. **Name** the four cardinal directions and four intermediate directions
3. **Locate** directions on a compass rose
4. **Apply** directional knowledge to real-world scenarios using landmarks

### Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment

- **Remember (L1)**: Recall the names and positions of compass directions
- **Apply (L3)**: Use directional knowledge in the quiz to identify directions

### Suggested Activities

1. **Warm-Up (5 minutes)**: Ask students to point in different directions around the classroom
2. **Explore Phase (5 minutes)**: Let students click each direction to learn the landmarks
3. **Practice Phase (5 minutes)**: Have students practice with the quiz mode
4. **Challenge (5 minutes)**: Students compete to see who can get the highest score

### Assessment Opportunities

- Monitor quiz scores as formative assessment
- Ask students to describe a path between two landmarks using directions
- Have students create their own landmark associations for directions

### Extensions

- Have students create a compass rose for their neighborhood
- Practice giving directions using only cardinal and intermediate directions
- Connect to map reading skills with actual maps
