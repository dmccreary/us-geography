## About This MicroSim

Compare two essential map types:

**Political Maps** show:

- Country and state borders
- Capital cities (marked with stars)
- Different colors for different regions

**Physical Maps** show:

- Mountains and elevation
- Rivers and lakes
- Plains, deserts, and forests

## How to Use

1. **Split View** - See both map types side by side
2. **Political** - Focus on the political map only
3. **Physical** - Focus on the physical map only
4. **Quiz Me!** - Test your knowledge of map types

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Political maps emphasize human-made boundaries
- Physical maps emphasize natural features
- Cartographers choose map types based on purpose
- Both map types are useful for different tasks

## Lesson Plan
