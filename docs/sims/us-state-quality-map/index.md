## How the Grading Works

Each state is evaluated on 8 metrics and compared to the national average. The color grade reflects how many metrics are better than average:

| Grade | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 8/8 | Dark Green | All metrics better than national average |
| 7/8 | Green | 7 metrics better, 1 worse |
| 6/8 | Medium Green | 6 metrics better, 2 worse |
| 5/8 | Light Green | 5 metrics better, 3 worse |
| 4/8 | Yellow | 4 metrics better, 4 worse (average) |
| 3/8 | Orange | 3 metrics better, 5 worse |
| 2/8 | Deep Orange | 2 metrics better, 6 worse |
| 1/8 | Red | 1 metric better, 7 worse |
| 0/8 | Dark Red | All metrics worse than national average |

## The 8 Quality of Life Metrics

### Economic Metrics

1. **Personal Income (Cost-of-Living Adjusted)**

      - Percentage of population below poverty line
      - Adjusted using Supplemental Poverty Measure for regional cost differences
      - National Average: 11.5%

### Education

3. **Education Attainment**

      - National Average: 33.0%

### Health Metrics

4. **Life Expectancy**
      - Average life expectancy at birth in years
      - Higher values indicate better overall health outcomes

5. **Infant Mortality Rate**
      - Deaths per 1,000 live births
      - Lower values indicate better maternal and infant healthcare
      - National Average: 5.5 per 1,000

### Safety & Affordability

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Composite Index Simplicity:** Each metric is given equal weight. Different weighting could produce different rankings.

2. **Temporal Variations:** Data from 2022-2024 sources; conditions change over time.

3. **State Averages:** State-level data masks significant intra-state variation (urban vs. rural, etc.).

4. **Metric Selection:** These 8 metrics were chosen for data availability and relevance, but other factors (climate, air quality, commute times, etc.) could also be included.

5. **Cost-of-Living Trade-offs:** States with low housing costs may also have fewer job opportunities or lower wages.
