## About This MicroSim

This interactive map helps students learn the geographic position of the United States by exploring:

- The US location within North America
- Bordering countries (Canada and Mexico)
- Surrounding oceans (Atlantic and Pacific)
- The positions of Alaska and Hawaii
- Cardinal directions and hemispheres

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over any region (country or ocean) to see detailed information in the info panel
2. **Click** on a region to zoom in for closer inspection
3. Use the **Quiz Me!** button to test your knowledge with location questions
4. **Toggle Labels** to show or hide country/region names
5. **Reset View** to return to the default map position
6. Track your **Score** as you answer quiz questions correctly

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **United States Location**: Position in the middle of North America
- **Hemispheres**: The US is in both the Northern and Western Hemispheres
- **Neighboring Countries**: Canada (north) and Mexico (south)
- **Coastal Oceans**: Atlantic Ocean (east) and Pacific Ocean (west)
- **Non-contiguous States**: Alaska and Hawaii are part of the US but not connected to the main landmass

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will locate and describe the position of the United States relative to neighboring countries, oceans, and hemispheres.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level:** Understand (L2)

**Activities:**

1. **Explore Mode (5 min)**: Have students hover over each region and read the facts displayed in the info panel
2. **Quiz Challenge (10 min)**: Students use Quiz Mode to answer location questions and track their scores
3. **Label Practice (5 min)**: Toggle labels off and have students verbally identify each region from memory
4. **Discussion (5 min)**: Ask students to explain why the US has borders with only two countries but touches three oceans

**Assessment:** Students should be able to correctly answer at least 6 of 8 quiz questions and verbally describe the US position using cardinal directions.
