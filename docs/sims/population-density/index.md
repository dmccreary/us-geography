## About This MicroSim

This choropleth map visualizes where Americans live:

- **Dark green** = Most densely populated (500+ people/sq mi)
- **Light yellow** = Least densely populated (under 25 people/sq mi)
- Hover over any state to see population data and density ranking

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **East Coast** states are much more densely populated
- **Mountain West** states have very low population density
- **New Jersey** is the most densely populated state
- **Alaska** is the least densely populated

## Lesson Plan

**Learning Objective:** Students will analyze population density patterns and explain why some areas have more people.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Level:** Analyze (L4)

**Activities:**

1. **Find Extremes (5 min)**: Identify the 5 most and least densely populated states
2. **Pattern Recognition (5 min)**: Why is the East Coast more crowded than the West?
3. **Discussion (5 min)**: What factors attract people to live in certain places?

## Technical Notes

- Built with Leaflet.js choropleth visualization
- Population data from 2020 US Census
- Density calculated as population ÷ land area
