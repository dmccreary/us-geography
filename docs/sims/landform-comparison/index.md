## About This MicroSim

Learn to identify and compare major landforms:

- **Mountains** - High elevation, steep slopes, peaks
- **Hills** - Lower than mountains, gentle slopes
- **Plateaus** - Flat tops at high elevation
- **Valleys** - Low areas between mountains or hills
- **Plains** - Large flat areas at low elevation

## Learning Objectives

After using this simulation, students will be able to:

- Identify each landform type by its characteristics
- Compare elevation and slope differences
- Understand how landforms affect human settlement
