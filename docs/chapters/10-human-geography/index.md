## Introduction to Human Geography

**Human geography** studies where people live and why they live there. It looks at how geography affects people's lives and how people change the land.

Think about where you live. Why did people first settle in that place? Was there a river for water and transportation? Good farmland? Natural resources? Human geography helps us understand these patterns.

Over 330 million people live in the United States. But they don't spread out evenly! Some places are crowded with people, while others are nearly empty. Let's explore why.

## Bays and Coastal Settlement

Many of America's largest cities were built near **bays**—protected areas of water along the coastline. Bays provided safe harbors for ships and access to trade routes.

### Chesapeake Bay

**Chesapeake Bay** is the largest estuary (where rivers meet the ocean) in the United States. It's surrounded by Maryland and Virginia.

The Chesapeake Bay is important because:

- It provides a protected harbor for ships
- Many rivers flow into it, giving access to inland areas
- Baltimore, Maryland grew as a major port here
- The bay supports fishing industries (especially blue crabs)
- Colonial settlements like Jamestown were founded nearby

### San Francisco Bay

**San Francisco Bay** on the Pacific coast is one of the world's great natural harbors. The famous Golden Gate strait connects the bay to the Pacific Ocean.

San Francisco Bay is important because:

- It's a protected harbor on the West Coast
- San Francisco grew as a major port during the Gold Rush
- Silicon Valley developed on the bay's southern shores
- Oakland across the bay is a major shipping port
- The bay supports diverse wildlife and wetlands

| Bay | Location | Major Cities | Why Important |
|-----|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Chesapeake | Maryland/Virginia | Baltimore | Largest US estuary, fishing |
| San Francisco | California | San Francisco, Oakland | Major Pacific port |
| New York Harbor | New York/New Jersey | New York City | Gateway for immigrants |
| Puget Sound | Washington | Seattle | Pacific Northwest trade |
| Tampa Bay | Florida | Tampa | Gulf Coast port |

## Population Density

**Population density** measures how many people live in a certain area. It's usually expressed as "people per square mile."

### Crowded vs. Empty Places

Some places are very crowded:

- **New York City**: Over 27,000 people per square mile in Manhattan!
- **New Jersey**: Most densely populated state (about 1,200 per square mile)

Some places are nearly empty:

- **Alaska**: Only about 1 person per square mile
- **Wyoming**: About 6 people per square mile

### Why Density Varies

Population density depends on:

- **Climate**: People prefer mild, comfortable climates
- **Water**: People need water for drinking and farming
- **Jobs**: People go where there's work
- **History**: Some places were settled earlier
- **Geography**: Flat land is easier to build on than mountains

!!! tip "Think About It"
    The entire state of Wyoming has fewer people than many single neighborhoods in New York City. Both are part of the same country!

## Urban, Suburban, and Rural Areas

People in the United States live in three main types of communities:

### Urban Areas

**Urban areas** are cities with dense populations. Characteristics include:

- Tall buildings and apartments
- Public transportation (buses, subways)
- Many businesses, stores, and restaurants
- Cultural attractions (museums, theaters)
- Diverse population
- Higher cost of living

### Suburbs

**Suburbs** are communities surrounding cities. Characteristics include:

- Single-family houses with yards
- Less crowded than cities
- People often drive cars
- Shopping malls and strip malls
- Good schools
- Many people commute to city jobs

### Rural Areas

**Rural areas** are the countryside, far from cities. Characteristics include:

- Farms, forests, or open land
- Very low population density
- People often know their neighbors
- Longer distances to stores and services
- Agriculture, mining, or forestry jobs
- Quiet, natural settings

| Community Type | Population | Transportation | Landscape |
|----------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Urban (City) | Dense | Walk, subway, bus | Tall buildings |
| Suburban | Moderate | Car | Houses, malls |
| Rural | Sparse | Car (long distances) | Farms, forest |

!!! info "Where Do Americans Live?"
    - About 83% of Americans live in urban or suburban areas
    - Only about 17% live in rural areas
    - The suburbs have grown fastest since the 1950s

---

## Metropolitan Areas

A **metropolitan area** includes a major city and all the surrounding communities that are connected to it economically. People in the suburbs work, shop, and play in the central city.

The largest US metropolitan areas have millions of people spread across many counties and sometimes multiple states!

### America's Largest Metro Areas

| Rank | Metro Area | Population | States |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | New York | 19+ million | NY, NJ, CT, PA |
| 2 | Los Angeles | 13+ million | California |
| 3 | Chicago | 9+ million | IL, IN, WI |
| 4 | Dallas-Fort Worth | 7+ million | Texas |
| 5 | Houston | 7+ million | Texas |

## Cultural Regions

**Cultural regions** are areas where people share similar traditions, foods, music, and ways of life. These regions don't follow state borders—they're based on shared culture.

### Examples of Cultural Regions

| Region | States Included | Cultural Features |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| New England | Northeast states | Colonial history, seafood, fall foliage |
| The Deep South | SE states | Southern hospitality, comfort food, blues |
| Appalachia | Mountain areas | Folk music, crafts, coal mining heritage |
| The Southwest | AZ, NM, TX | Hispanic culture, adobe, spicy food |
| Pacific Northwest | WA, OR | Outdoor culture, coffee, tech industry |

### What Creates Cultural Regions?

Cultural regions form because of:

- **History**: Who first settled the area
- **Geography**: Mountains or rivers that isolated communities
- **Immigration**: Groups who brought their traditions
- **Economy**: Types of jobs (farming, mining, fishing)
- **Religion**: Shared faith communities

## Native American Lands

**Native American lands** include reservations where tribes have self-governance and maintain their cultural traditions.

### Understanding Reservations

- There are over 300 Indian reservations in the United States
- Reservations are sovereign nations within the US
- Tribes have their own governments, laws, and sometimes courts
- The largest reservation is the Navajo Nation (Arizona, New Mexico, Utah)

### Largest Native American Reservations

| Reservation | Location | Tribe | Size |
|-------------|----------|-------|------|
| Navajo Nation | AZ, NM, UT | Navajo | 27,000 sq miles |
| Uintah and Ouray | Utah | Ute | 6,800 sq miles |
| Tohono O'odham | Arizona | O'odham | 4,460 sq miles |
| Pine Ridge | South Dakota | Lakota Sioux | 3,500 sq miles |

!!! note "Native American Heritage"
    Native American peoples have lived on this land for thousands of years before European settlers arrived. Today's reservations are just a small portion of their original territories.

---

## Immigration Patterns

**Immigration** is when people move to a new country to live. The United States has always been shaped by immigration.

### Waves of Immigration

| Period | Who Came | Where They Settled |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 1600s-1700s | British, Dutch | East Coast |
| 1840s-1860s | Irish, German | East Coast, Midwest |
| 1880s-1920s | Italians, Eastern Europeans | Northeast cities |
| 1900s-present | Mexicans, Central Americans | Southwest, California |
| 1970s-present | Asians | California, major cities |

### How Immigration Shaped Cities

Immigration created diverse neighborhoods in American cities:

- **Chinatowns** in San Francisco, New York, and other cities
- **Little Italy** neighborhoods in many eastern cities
- **Hispanic barrios** in southwestern cities
- **Korean, Vietnamese, and other Asian** communities

Today, about 14% of Americans were born in another country. Cities like Miami, Los Angeles, and New York have very diverse populations from all over the world.

## Review Questions

??? question "Why did many large cities develop near bays?"
    Large cities developed near **bays** because:

    - Bays provide **protected harbors** where ships can dock safely
    - Ships could bring goods and people for **trade**
    - Rivers flowing into bays gave **access to inland areas**
    - The water provided **food** (fish, shellfish)
    - Bays made good **military defenses**

    Examples include San Francisco (San Francisco Bay), Baltimore (Chesapeake Bay), and New York (New York Harbor).

??? question "What is the difference between urban, suburban, and rural areas?"
    The three types of communities differ in many ways:

    - **Urban (cities)**: Dense population, tall buildings, public transit, walking, many businesses and services close together

    - **Suburban**: Moderate density, single-family homes with yards, people drive cars, shopping malls, residential neighborhoods around cities

    - **Rural**: Sparse population, farms and open land, long distances between places, agriculture and natural resource jobs

??? question "Name the five largest cities in the United States and one thing each is known for."
    The five largest US cities are:

    1. **New York City** - Financial center (Wall Street), Statue of Liberty
    2. **Los Angeles** - Entertainment industry (Hollywood)
    3. **Chicago** - Skyscrapers, deep-dish pizza
    4. **Houston** - NASA Space Center, oil industry
    5. **Phoenix** - Desert climate, retirement communities

??? question "What is a cultural region? Give an example."
    A **cultural region** is an area where people share similar traditions, foods, music, and ways of life. Cultural regions don't follow state borders—they're based on shared culture.

    Example: **The Deep South** includes parts of several southeastern states. People there share traditions like Southern hospitality, comfort food (biscuits, fried chicken, sweet tea), blues and country music, and a slower pace of life.

??? question "What are Native American reservations, and what is the largest one?"
    **Native American reservations** are lands where Native American tribes have self-governance. Tribes have their own governments and can make many of their own laws.

    The largest reservation is the **Navajo Nation**, which covers about 27,000 square miles across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. It's larger than 10 US states!

??? question "How has immigration shaped the population of the United States?"
    Immigration has shaped America in many ways:

    - Different waves of immigrants came from different places over time
    - Immigrants created diverse neighborhoods (Chinatowns, Little Italy, Hispanic barrios)
    - About 14% of Americans today were born in another country
    - Cities like Miami, Los Angeles, and New York are very diverse
    - Immigrants brought their food, music, languages, and traditions
    - America is sometimes called a "nation of immigrants"
