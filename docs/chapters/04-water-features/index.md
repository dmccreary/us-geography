## Introduction to Water Features

Water is everywhere in America! Rivers flow across the land like nature's highways. Lakes hold fresh water that people, animals, and plants need to survive. Oceans surround the United States on three sides. All these water features shape the land and affect how people live.

Think about all the ways you use water every day. You drink it, wash with it, and swim in it. Now imagine water features so big that boats can travel on them for thousands of miles. That's what America's rivers and lakes are like!

## Major River Systems

### The Mississippi River

The **Mississippi River** is the most important river in the United States. It flows from Minnesota all the way to the Gulf of Mexico—that's about 2,340 miles! The name "Mississippi" comes from a Native American word meaning "great river" or "father of waters."

The Mississippi River acts like a giant water highway. Boats and barges carry goods up and down the river. Farmers ship their crops on it. Cities like Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans grew up along its banks.

!!! info "Mississippi River Fast Facts"
    - Length: 2,340 miles
    - Starts: Lake Itasca, Minnesota
    - Ends: Gulf of Mexico
    - States it touches: 10 states

### The Missouri River

The **Missouri River** is the longest river in North America—even longer than the Mississippi! It stretches 2,341 miles from Montana to where it joins the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri.

Lewis and Clark followed the Missouri River on their famous journey to explore the western United States. The river flows through the Great Plains and provides water for farms and cities.

### The Colorado River

The **Colorado River** carved one of the world's most amazing wonders—the Grand Canyon! This river flows through the dry Southwest, bringing precious water to Arizona, Nevada, and California.

| River | Length | Key Feature |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Mississippi | 2,340 miles | Largest drainage basin in North America |
| Missouri | 2,341 miles | Longest river in North America |
| Colorado | 1,450 miles | Carved the Grand Canyon |
| Columbia | 1,243 miles | Major hydroelectric power source |
| Ohio | 981 miles | Important shipping route |
| Rio Grande | 1,896 miles | Forms border with Mexico |

### The Columbia River

The **Columbia River** flows through the Pacific Northwest, from Canada through Washington and Oregon to the Pacific Ocean. Dams on the Columbia produce more hydroelectric power than any other river system in North America.

Salmon swim up the Columbia River to lay their eggs. The river was vital to Native American tribes and later to settlers traveling the Oregon Trail.

### The Ohio River

The **Ohio River** forms the border between several states as it flows from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to the Mississippi River. Its name means "great river" in the Iroquois language.

The Ohio River was a major route for settlers moving west. Today, it carries more cargo than any other river in America.

### The Rio Grande

The **Rio Grande** forms the border between the United States and Mexico for about 1,900 miles. "Rio Grande" means "big river" in Spanish. In Mexico, it's called the Río Bravo.

### The Hudson River

The **Hudson River** flows through New York State past New York City to the Atlantic Ocean. This river helped New York City become America's largest city because ships could travel far inland.

## The Great Lakes

The **Great Lakes** are five huge freshwater lakes located between the United States and Canada. Together, they hold about 20% of the world's fresh surface water! That's an amazing amount of water in one place.

### Remembering the Great Lakes: HOMES

An easy way to remember all five Great Lakes is the word **HOMES**:

- **H** - Huron
- **O** - Ontario
- **M** - Michigan
- **E** - Erie
- **S** - Superior

### Lake Superior

**Lake Superior** is the largest of the Great Lakes and the largest freshwater lake in the world by surface area. It's so big that all the other Great Lakes could fit inside it! "Superior" means "upper" because it's the farthest north.

### Lake Michigan

**Lake Michigan** is the only Great Lake entirely inside the United States. Chicago, one of America's largest cities, sits on its shores. The lake is famous for its beautiful beaches and sand dunes.

### Lake Huron

**Lake Huron** connects to Lake Michigan through the Straits of Mackinac. It contains Manitoulin Island, the largest island in any freshwater lake in the world.

### Lake Erie

**Lake Erie** is the shallowest of the Great Lakes. Because it's not very deep, it's the warmest Great Lake in summer and can freeze over in cold winters.

### Lake Ontario

**Lake Ontario** is the smallest Great Lake by surface area, but it's very deep. Water from all the other Great Lakes eventually flows through Lake Ontario and out to the Atlantic Ocean through the St. Lawrence River.

| Great Lake | Size Rank | Special Feature |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Superior | Largest | Largest freshwater lake by area in the world |
| Michigan | 2nd | Only Great Lake entirely in the US |
| Huron | 3rd | Has Manitoulin Island |
| Erie | 4th | Shallowest Great Lake |
| Ontario | Smallest | Connects to Atlantic Ocean |

!!! tip "Think About It"
    Water flows from Lake Superior down through all the Great Lakes and eventually to the Atlantic Ocean. It's like a giant staircase of water!

### The Great Salt Lake

The **Great Salt Lake** in Utah is very different from the Great Lakes. It has no outlet to the ocean, so the water stays in the lake and gets saltier as it evaporates. You can float easily in the Great Salt Lake because the salty water makes you more buoyant!

## Oceans Bordering the United States

The United States is bordered by three major oceans. Oceans affect weather, provide food, and allow ships to travel between countries.

### The Atlantic Ocean

The **Atlantic Ocean** borders the entire eastern coast of the United States, from Maine to Florida. Early European settlers crossed this ocean to reach America. Major cities like Boston, New York, and Miami are Atlantic ports.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second-largest ocean in the world. It brings warm water up from the south, making the eastern coast warmer than it might otherwise be.

### The Pacific Ocean

The **Pacific Ocean** is the largest ocean on Earth—it covers more area than all the land on Earth combined! It borders the western United States from Washington to California, plus Alaska and Hawaii.

The Pacific Ocean gives California and the Pacific Northwest mild, wet weather. Major Pacific ports include Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.

### The Gulf of Mexico

The **Gulf of Mexico** is a warm body of water bordered by Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. It's part of the Atlantic Ocean but is sheltered by land on three sides.

The Gulf of Mexico is important for:

- Fishing and shrimp harvesting
- Oil and gas drilling
- Shipping routes
- Beach tourism

!!! warning "Hurricane Alley"
    Warm water in the Gulf of Mexico helps hurricanes form and grow stronger. States along the Gulf Coast must prepare for hurricane season every year.

### The Arctic Ocean

The **Arctic Ocean** borders Alaska in the far north. It's the smallest and coldest ocean, covered with ice for much of the year. As the climate warms, the Arctic Ocean is becoming more accessible for shipping.

## How Water Features Connect

America's water features aren't separate—they connect to form systems. The Mississippi River and its tributaries drain 31 states! Water from the Rocky Mountains flows through the Colorado River to the Pacific. The Great Lakes connect to the Atlantic through the St. Lawrence River.

### Watersheds

A **watershed** is all the land that drains into a particular river or lake. When rain falls on the ground, it flows downhill into streams, then rivers, and finally to the ocean or a lake.

The Mississippi River watershed is the largest in North America. It covers 1.2 million square miles—that's 40% of the lower 48 states!

| Watershed | Drains to | Size |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Mississippi River | Gulf of Mexico | 1.2 million sq miles |
| Colorado River | Gulf of California | 246,000 sq miles |
| Columbia River | Pacific Ocean | 258,000 sq miles |
| Great Lakes-St. Lawrence | Atlantic Ocean | 94,000 sq miles |

## Review Questions

??? question "What are the five Great Lakes? Use the HOMES memory trick to name them all."
    The five Great Lakes are:

    - **H**uron
    - **O**ntario
    - **M**ichigan
    - **E**rie
    - **S**uperior

??? question "Which river is the longest in North America, and where does it flow?"
    The **Missouri River** is the longest river in North America at 2,341 miles. It flows from Montana to where it joins the Mississippi River near St. Louis, Missouri.

??? question "What makes the Great Salt Lake different from the Great Lakes?"
    The Great Salt Lake has no outlet to the ocean, so water stays and evaporates, leaving salt behind. This makes it extremely salty—so salty you can float easily! The Great Lakes are freshwater lakes that eventually drain to the Atlantic Ocean.

??? question "Which ocean is the largest in the world, and which coast of the US does it border?"
    The **Pacific Ocean** is the largest ocean in the world. It borders the western coast of the United States, from Washington to California, plus Alaska and Hawaii.

??? question "What is a watershed, and why is the Mississippi River watershed important?"
    A **watershed** is all the land that drains into a particular river or lake. The Mississippi River watershed is important because it drains 1.2 million square miles—that's 31 states and 40% of the lower 48 states! It's the largest watershed in North America.

??? question "Why did major cities develop near water features? Give at least three reasons."
    Major cities developed near water features because:

    1. **Transportation** - Ships and boats could bring goods and people
    2. **Fresh water** - People need water to drink and for daily use
    3. **Food** - Rivers and oceans provide fish and support farming
    4. **Trade** - Water routes connected cities to other places
    5. **Power** - Rivers could power mills and later generate electricity
