## What is Geography?

Have you ever wondered why some places have mountains while others are flat? Or why it snows in some states but never in others? **Geography** is the study of places and how they are different from each other. It helps us understand our world!

Geography answers questions like:

- Where are places located?
- What do places look like?
- Why do people live where they do?
- How do places change over time?

When you study geography, you become an explorer! You learn about mountains, rivers, deserts, and cities. You discover how people in different places live, work, and play.

!!! tip "Geography is Everywhere"
    Everything around you connects to geography—your home, your school, the weather outside, and even the food you eat comes from somewhere on Earth!

## Reading Maps

A **map** is a drawing that shows what a place looks like from above—like a bird's eye view! Maps help us find places and understand the world around us.

There are many types of maps:

- **Political maps** show countries, states, and cities
- **Physical maps** show mountains, rivers, and landforms
- **Road maps** help people find their way when driving
- **Weather maps** show rain, snow, and temperature

Every map tells a story about a place. Learning to read maps is like learning a new language!

<summary>Bird's Eye View Comparison MicroSim</summary>
Type: microsim

Learning Objective: Help students understand (L2) how maps show places from above by comparing a 3D scene to its map view.

Bloom Level: Understand
Bloom Verb: explain, compare

Visual Elements:
- Left panel: 3D isometric view of a simple neighborhood with houses, trees, roads, and a pond
- Right panel: Same neighborhood shown as a simple map from above
- Matching colors between 3D objects and map symbols

Interactive Controls:
- Highlight button for each element (house, tree, road, pond)
- When clicked, both the 3D object and map symbol glow/highlight
- Toggle switch to show/hide labels on the map

Canvas Layout:
- Width: responsive to container
- Height: 400px
- Split view: 50% 3D scene, 50% map view

Behavior:
- Clicking an object in either view highlights it in both views
- Helps students see the connection between real places and maps

Instructional Rationale: The side-by-side comparison with interactive highlighting helps students understand the abstract concept of map representation by connecting familiar 3D objects to their 2D map symbols.

Implementation: p5.js with simple geometric shapes for both views

## Cardinal Directions

To find your way on a map, you need to know the four main **cardinal directions**:

| Direction | What it Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **North** | Toward the top of most maps, toward the North Pole |
| **South** | Toward the bottom of most maps, toward the South Pole |
| **East** | Toward the right on most maps, where the sun rises |
| **West** | Toward the left on most maps, where the sun sets |

Here's an easy way to remember them! Starting at the top and going clockwise, the first letters spell: **N-E-S-W**. Some students remember it as "**N**ever **E**at **S**oggy **W**affles!"

There are also directions in between:

- **Northeast** (NE) - between north and east
- **Southeast** (SE) - between south and east
- **Southwest** (SW) - between south and west
- **Northwest** (NW) - between north and west

## The Compass Rose

A **compass rose** is a symbol on maps that shows directions. It looks like a star with points showing north, south, east, and west. Most compass roses also show the in-between directions.

The compass rose helps you orient yourself on a map. The "N" always points toward the top of the map (north), so you know which way is which!

## Map Scale

Have you noticed that maps are much smaller than the real places they show? A **map scale** tells you how distances on the map compare to distances in the real world.

For example, a scale might show that 1 inch on the map equals 100 miles in real life. This helps you figure out how far apart places really are!

Map scales can be shown in different ways:

- **Bar scale**: A small ruler printed on the map
- **Written scale**: Words like "1 inch = 50 miles"
- **Ratio scale**: Numbers like "1:1,000,000"

!!! example "Try This!"
    Look at a map of your state. Use the scale to figure out how far your town is from the state capital!

## Map Legend

A **map legend** (also called a map key) explains what the symbols and colors on a map mean. Without a legend, you might not understand what you're looking at!

Common map symbols include:

| Symbol | What it Usually Means |
|--------|----------------------|
| ⭐ | Capital city |
| ● | City or town |
| ✈️ | Airport |
| 🏔️ | Mountain |
| Blue lines | Rivers |
| Blue areas | Lakes or oceans |
| Green areas | Parks or forests |

Every map can have different symbols, so always check the legend first!

## Hemispheres

The Earth is shaped like a giant ball (called a sphere). We can divide this ball into halves called **hemispheres**. "Hemi" means half, so hemisphere means "half-sphere."

The Earth has four hemispheres:

- **Northern Hemisphere**: Everything north of the equator (top half)
- **Southern Hemisphere**: Everything south of the equator (bottom half)
- **Eastern Hemisphere**: Everything east of the Prime Meridian (right half)
- **Western Hemisphere**: Everything west of the Prime Meridian (left half)

The United States is in both the Northern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere!

## The Seven Continents

The land on Earth is divided into seven large areas called **continents**. A continent is a huge piece of land that contains many countries.

The seven continents are:

1. **Africa** - The second-largest continent, home to deserts and savannas
2. **Antarctica** - The frozen continent at the South Pole
3. **Asia** - The largest continent, home to China, India, and Japan
4. **Australia** - The smallest continent, also a country
5. **Europe** - Home to France, Germany, and many other countries
6. **North America** - Where the United States, Canada, and Mexico are located
7. **South America** - Home to Brazil, the Amazon rainforest, and the Andes Mountains

!!! note "Continent or Country?"
    Don't confuse continents with countries! A continent is much bigger and contains many countries. For example, North America is a continent that includes the countries of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

## North America

**North America** is the continent where we live! It is the third-largest continent and stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to Central America in the south.

North America includes:

- **Canada** - Our neighbor to the north
- **United States** - Our country!
- **Mexico** - Our neighbor to the south
- **Central American countries** - Like Guatemala and Costa Rica
- **Caribbean islands** - Like Cuba and Jamaica

North America has amazing variety—from frozen tundra in Alaska to tropical beaches in Florida, from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains.

## Where is the United States?

The **United States** is located in the middle of North America. It is one of the largest countries in the world!

Here's how to find the United States on a map:

- It's in the **Northern Hemisphere** (above the equator)
- It's in the **Western Hemisphere** (west of the Prime Meridian)
- It has **Canada** as its neighbor to the north
- It has **Mexico** as its neighbor to the south
- The **Atlantic Ocean** is on its east coast
- The **Pacific Ocean** is on its west coast

The United States also includes Alaska (northwest of Canada) and Hawaii (islands in the Pacific Ocean).

## US Borders

The **borders** of the United States are the lines that separate our country from other countries. The US has two land borders and two ocean "borders."

| Border | What's There |
|--------|-------------|
| Northern border | Canada - the longest border between any two countries! |
| Southern border | Mexico - runs from California to Texas |
| Eastern coast | Atlantic Ocean |
| Western coast | Pacific Ocean |

The border with Canada stretches for about 5,525 miles! That's longer than driving from New York to Los Angeles and back.

## How Big is the United States?

The United States is the **third-largest country** in the world by land area. Only Russia and Canada are bigger!

Here are some fun facts about the size of the US:

- It covers about **3.8 million square miles**
- It stretches across **4 time zones** (not counting Alaska and Hawaii)
- It takes about **40 hours** of driving to cross from coast to coast
- You could fit almost **500 Delawares** inside Texas!

Some size comparisons:

| Country | Size Compared to US |
|---------|-------------------|
| Russia | About 1.8 times bigger |
| Canada | Slightly bigger |
| China | Slightly smaller |
| United Kingdom | The US is about 40 times bigger! |

## Time Zones

Because the United States is so wide, different parts of the country experience different times of day! When people in New York are eating lunch, people in California are just waking up.

The world is divided into **time zones** to handle this. Each zone is about 15 degrees of longitude wide, and time changes by one hour as you move from one zone to the next.

The continental United States has four main time zones:

1. **Eastern Time** - New York, Florida, Maine
2. **Central Time** - Chicago, Texas, Minnesota
3. **Mountain Time** - Denver, Phoenix, Utah
4. **Pacific Time** - California, Oregon, Washington

Alaska and Hawaii have their own time zones too!

</details>

!!! question "Think About It"
    If you called your grandparents in New York at noon your time in California, what time would it be for them? (Answer: 3:00 PM - three hours later!)

## The World's Oceans

**Oceans** are huge bodies of salt water that cover most of Earth's surface. In fact, about 71% of Earth is covered by oceans!

There are five oceans on Earth:

| Ocean | Location | Fun Fact |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Pacific Ocean** | West of the Americas | Largest ocean—covers more area than all land combined! |
| **Atlantic Ocean** | East of the Americas | Second largest, separates Americas from Europe and Africa |
| **Indian Ocean** | South of Asia | Third largest, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere |
| **Southern Ocean** | Around Antarctica | Coldest ocean |
| **Arctic Ocean** | Around the North Pole | Smallest and shallowest ocean, mostly covered in ice |

The United States touches three oceans:

- The **Pacific Ocean** on the west coast and around Alaska and Hawaii
- The **Atlantic Ocean** on the east coast
- The **Arctic Ocean** on the northern coast of Alaska

## What is Climate?

**Climate** is the typical weather pattern of a place over a long time—usually 30 years or more. It's different from weather, which is what's happening outside right now!

Think of it this way:

- **Weather** = "Is it raining today?"
- **Climate** = "How much rain does this place usually get?"

Climate includes:

- How hot or cold a place usually is
- How much rain or snow falls each year
- How much sunshine a place gets
- What seasons are like

Different parts of the United States have very different climates:

| Region | Climate Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Florida | Hot and humid with lots of rain |
| Arizona | Hot and dry (desert climate) |
| Alaska | Very cold with long winters |
| Pacific Northwest | Mild and rainy |
| Midwest | Hot summers and cold winters |

Understanding climate helps us know what clothes to pack, what crops can grow, and what animals can live in different places!
