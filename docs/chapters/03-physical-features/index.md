## America's Amazing Landforms

The United States has some of the most diverse landforms in the world! From towering mountains to flat plains, from scorching deserts to beautiful coastlines, our country has it all. In this chapter, you'll explore the physical features that make America's landscape so incredible.

## Mountains

**Mountains** are the tallest landforms on Earth. They rise high above the surrounding land and often have steep sides and pointed or rounded tops called peaks.

Key facts about mountains:

- They are formed when Earth's crust pushes together
- The highest peaks may be covered with snow year-round
- Mountains can affect weather patterns—one side may be wet while the other is dry
- Many rivers begin in mountain snowfields

The United States has several major mountain ranges:

| Mountain Range | Location | Highest Peak |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| Rocky Mountains | Western US | Mt. Elbert (14,440 ft) |
| Appalachian Mountains | Eastern US | Mt. Mitchell (6,684 ft) |
| Sierra Nevada | California | Mt. Whitney (14,505 ft) |
| Cascade Range | Pacific Northwest | Mt. Rainier (14,411 ft) |
| Alaska Range | Alaska | Denali (20,310 ft) |

!!! note "Highest Mountain in North America"
    Denali in Alaska is the highest mountain in all of North America at 20,310 feet! It was formerly called Mt. McKinley.

## Plains

**Plains** are large, flat or gently rolling areas of land. They are often covered with grasses or used for farming because the flat land makes it easy to grow crops.

Types of plains in the United States:

- **Coastal plains** - Flat land along the ocean (Atlantic and Gulf coasts)
- **Interior plains** - Flat land in the middle of the country
- **Great Plains** - A huge grassland region in the central US

Plains are important because:

- They have rich soil for farming
- They're easy to travel across
- Many large cities developed on plains
- They support grassland animals like bison and prairie dogs

## Plateaus

A **plateau** is a flat, raised area of land—like a giant table! Plateaus are higher than the land around them but have flat tops, unlike mountains.

Facts about plateaus:

- They are sometimes called "tablelands"
- They can be formed by volcanic activity or by layers of rock pushed up
- Rivers often cut deep canyons through plateaus
- They can be hot deserts or cool highlands

Famous US plateaus include:

| Plateau | Location | Special Features |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Colorado Plateau | AZ, UT, CO, NM | Home to the Grand Canyon |
| Columbia Plateau | WA, OR, ID | Formed by ancient lava flows |
| Ozark Plateau | MO, AR, OK | Rolling hills and caves |
| Edwards Plateau | Texas | "Texas Hill Country" |

## Valleys

A **valley** is low land between mountains or hills. Valleys are often formed by rivers cutting through rock over millions of years, or by glaciers (giant ice sheets) carving out the land.

Types of valleys:

- **River valleys** - Shaped like a "V" because rivers cut downward
- **Glacial valleys** - Shaped like a "U" because glaciers carved them wider
- **Rift valleys** - Formed when Earth's crust pulls apart

Famous valleys in the United States:

- **Central Valley** in California - One of the world's most productive farming regions
- **Death Valley** in California - The lowest and hottest place in North America
- **Shenandoah Valley** in Virginia - A beautiful valley in the Appalachian Mountains

Many cities are built in valleys because:

- Rivers provide water
- The land is flat and easy to build on
- Mountains provide protection from harsh weather

## Hills

**Hills** are raised areas of land that are smaller and rounder than mountains. There's no exact rule for when a hill becomes a mountain, but hills are generally under 1,000-2,000 feet tall.

Characteristics of hills:

- Lower and more rounded than mountains
- Usually covered with grass, trees, or farms
- Easier to climb than mountains
- Found throughout the United States

Hilly regions of the US include:

- The Ozark Hills in Missouri and Arkansas
- The Black Hills of South Dakota
- The rolling hills of New England
- The Piedmont region between the Appalachians and the coast

## Deserts

A **desert** is an area that receives very little precipitation—usually less than 10 inches per year. Deserts can be hot or cold, but they are always dry!

US deserts include:

| Desert | Location | Features |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Mojave Desert | CA, NV, UT, AZ | Death Valley, Joshua trees |
| Sonoran Desert | AZ, CA, Mexico | Saguaro cacti, hot summers |
| Chihuahuan Desert | NM, TX, Mexico | Largest North American desert |

Desert adaptations:

- Plants have thick stems to store water (like cacti)
- Animals are often nocturnal (active at night when it's cooler)
- Some areas have no plants at all (like sand dunes)

!!! tip "Not All Deserts Are Hot"
    The Great Basin Desert in Nevada and Utah is a **cold desert**—it gets snow in winter! Antarctica is also considered a desert because it gets very little precipitation.

## Coastal Areas

**Coastal areas** are places where the land meets the ocean. The United States has thousands of miles of coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico.

Types of coastal features:

- **Beaches** - Sandy or rocky shores
- **Cliffs** - Steep rock faces along the coast
- **Bays** - Bodies of water partly surrounded by land
- **Harbors** - Protected areas for ships
- **Wetlands** - Marshy areas where land meets water

The US coastline includes:

| Coast | States | Features |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Atlantic Coast | Maine to Florida | Beaches, bays, barrier islands |
| Gulf Coast | Florida to Texas | Wetlands, bayous, barrier islands |
| Pacific Coast | California to Washington | Cliffs, beaches, sea stacks |
| Alaska Coast | Alaska | Fjords, glaciers, islands |

Coastal areas are important for:

- Fishing and shipping

- **Long Island** - Off the coast of New York City
- **Puerto Rico** - A US territory in the Caribbean
- **Kodiak Island** - A large island in Alaska

## Peninsulas

A **peninsula** is land surrounded by water on three sides but connected to the mainland on one side. The word comes from Latin: "paene" (almost) + "insula" (island).

Major US peninsulas:

| Peninsula | Location | Features |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Florida | Southeast US | Surrounded by Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico |
| Delmarva | MD, DE, VA | Between Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic |
| Upper Peninsula | Michigan | Between Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron |
| Olympic Peninsula | Washington | Rainforests and mountains |
| Baja California | Mexico (near US) | Desert peninsula |

!!! question "Think About It"
    Florida is the most famous US peninsula. Can you find it on a map? Notice how water surrounds it on the east (Atlantic Ocean), west (Gulf of Mexico), and south!

## The Rocky Mountains

The **Rocky Mountains** (often called "the Rockies") are the largest mountain system in North America. They stretch over 3,000 miles from New Mexico all the way to Canada and Alaska!

Rocky Mountain facts:

- They formed about 80-55 million years ago
- They pass through 6 US states: NM, CO, WY, MT, ID, UT

Appalachian Mountain facts:

- They formed about 480 million years ago (very ancient!)
- They stretch from Alabama to Maine and into Canada
- They are lower and more rounded than the Rockies (erosion over time)
- The Appalachian Trail runs 2,190 miles along the range

Sub-ranges of the Appalachians:

| Sub-range | Location | Features |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Great Smoky Mountains | TN, NC | Most visited national park |
| Blue Ridge Mountains | VA, NC, GA | Beautiful blue haze |
| White Mountains | NH, ME | Mt. Washington (severe weather) |
| Green Mountains | Vermont | Covered with forests |
| Allegheny Mountains | PA, WV, VA | Coal mining region |

The Appalachians were once as tall as the Rockies, but hundreds of millions of years of erosion wore them down to their current height.

## The Sierra Nevada

The **Sierra Nevada** ("Snowy Range" in Spanish) is a mountain range in eastern California. It contains the highest peak in the lower 48 states!

Sierra Nevada facts:

- Mt. Whitney (14,505 ft) is the highest peak in the lower 48 states

## Review Questions

??? question "What is the difference between a plateau and a plain?"
    A **plateau** is a flat area that is elevated (raised up) above the surrounding land—like a table. A **plain** is a flat area at a lower elevation. Plateaus have steep sides; plains are at ground level.

??? question "Which mountain range is older—the Rockies or the Appalachians?"
    The **Appalachian Mountains** are much older! They formed about 480 million years ago, while the Rockies formed about 80-55 million years ago. That's why the Appalachians are lower and more rounded—they've had more time to erode.

??? question "What is a peninsula?"
    A **peninsula** is land that is surrounded by water on three sides but connected to the mainland on one side. Florida is the most famous US peninsula.

??? question "Why are the Great Plains called the 'Breadbasket of America'?"
    The Great Plains have rich soil and flat land perfect for growing wheat, corn, and other grains. This region produces so much food that it "feeds" America and much of the world!

??? question "Name two national parks located on the Colorado Plateau."
    Grand Canyon National Park, Arches National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Mesa Verde National Park (any two are correct!)
