## Introduction to Regions and Organization

Now that we've traveled across all 50 states, let's step back and look at how the United States is organized. States are grouped into regions, each state has a capital city, and borders mark where one state ends and another begins.

In this chapter, we'll also learn about the remaining states and explore what makes each state unique through its symbols and flags.

## Completing Our Tour of the 50 States

Let's explore the remaining states we haven't covered in detail yet.

## State Capitals

Every state has a **capital city** where the state government meets. The capital is not always the largest city in the state!

### Surprising Capitals

Many people are surprised to learn which cities are actually state capitals:

| State | Capital | Larger City |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| New York | Albany | New York City |
| California | Sacramento | Los Angeles |
| Texas | Austin | Houston |
| Florida | Tallahassee | Miami |
| Illinois | Springfield | Chicago |
| Pennsylvania | Harrisburg | Philadelphia |

### Why Aren't the Biggest Cities Capitals?

When states chose their capitals, they often picked:

- A **central location** so everyone could reach it more easily
- A **smaller city** that wouldn't dominate state politics
- A **historical site** important to the state's founding

!!! tip "Learning State Capitals"
    There are 50 state capitals to learn! Try grouping them by region and learning a few at a time. Some capitals share the state's name, which makes them easier to remember: Oklahoma City (Oklahoma), Indianapolis (Indiana).

---

## Washington DC: The Nation's Capital

**Washington DC** is the capital of the entire United States, but it's not a state! DC stands for "District of Columbia."

### What Makes DC Special?

- Located between Maryland and Virginia
- Home to the President (the White House)
- Where Congress meets (the Capitol Building)
- Home to the Supreme Court
- Contains many important monuments and museums

### Famous DC Landmarks

| Landmark | What It Is |
|----------|-----------|
| The White House | Home of the President |
| Capitol Building | Where Congress meets |
| Washington Monument | Tall obelisk honoring George Washington |
| Lincoln Memorial | Memorial to President Lincoln |
| Smithsonian Museums | Free museums with art, history, science |

!!! info "DC Is Not a State"
    People who live in Washington DC pay taxes and follow US laws, but they don't have voting representatives in Congress. Many people think DC should become a state!

## State Borders

**State borders** are the lines that separate one state from another. Some borders are straight lines, while others follow natural features.

### Natural Borders

Many state borders follow rivers, mountains, or other natural features:

- **Mississippi River**: Forms the border between many states
- **Ohio River**: Separates Ohio from Kentucky and West Virginia
- **Rio Grande**: Forms the border between Texas and Mexico
- **Appalachian Mountains**: Divide eastern states

### Straight Line Borders

Western states often have straight-line borders because they were created later, when people used surveying tools to draw boundaries:

- Colorado is a perfect rectangle
- Wyoming is almost a perfect rectangle
- Many borders in the West follow lines of latitude or longitude

### Unusual Borders

Some state borders are surprising:

- **The Four Corners**: The only place where four states meet (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah)
- **West Virginia**: Has a strange shape because it separated from Virginia during the Civil War
- **Michigan**: Split into two parts (Upper and Lower Peninsulas)

## State Symbols

Every state has official **state symbols** that represent something special about that state. These symbols often reflect the state's history, geography, or natural features.

## Review Questions

??? question "Why is Washington DC not a state? What makes it special?"
    Washington DC is not a state because the Constitution created it as a special district for the national government. It's special because:

    - It's the **nation's capital** where the federal government is located
    - The **President** lives there (in the White House)
    - **Congress** meets there (in the Capitol Building)
    - The **Supreme Court** is located there
    - It contains many **monuments and museums** (Smithsonian)

    DC stands for "District of Columbia." People who live there don't have voting representatives in Congress.

??? question "Name three state capitals that are NOT the largest city in their state."
    Examples include:

    1. **New York**: Capital is Albany, but New York City is much larger
    2. **California**: Capital is Sacramento, but Los Angeles and San Francisco are larger
    3. **Texas**: Capital is Austin, but Houston and Dallas are larger
    4. **Florida**: Capital is Tallahassee, but Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville are larger
    5. **Illinois**: Capital is Springfield, but Chicago is much larger

??? question "What is the difference between natural borders and straight-line borders?"
    **Natural borders** follow geographic features like:

    - Rivers (Mississippi, Ohio, Rio Grande)
    - Mountains (Appalachians)
    - Lakes or coastlines

    **Straight-line borders** are drawn using surveying tools and often follow:

    - Lines of latitude (east-west)
    - Lines of longitude (north-south)

    Western states tend to have straight-line borders because they were created later, while eastern states often have natural borders.

??? question "What is the Four Corners, and which states meet there?"
    The **Four Corners** is the only place in the United States where four states meet at a single point. The four states are:

    - **Arizona** (southwest corner)
    - **New Mexico** (southeast corner)
    - **Colorado** (northeast corner)
    - **Utah** (northwest corner)

    You can stand in all four states at once at this location!

??? question "Name three types of state symbols and give an example of each."
    Three types of state symbols:

    1. **State Bird**: Examples include the Cardinal (Virginia, Ohio, and others), California Quail (California), or Mockingbird (Texas)

    2. **State Flower**: Examples include the Bluebonnet (Texas), California Poppy (California), or Rose (New York)

    3. **State Tree**: Examples include the Redwood (California), Sugar Maple (New York), or Pecan (Texas)

    Other symbols include state animals, state songs, and state mottos.

??? question "What makes Texas's flag special, and why is it called the 'Lone Star State'?"
    Texas's flag is called the **Lone Star Flag** because it has just one white star on a blue background, with red and white stripes. It's special because:

    - The single star represents Texas's history as an **independent republic** from 1836 to 1845
    - Texas was its own country before joining the United States
    - The flag design reflects this proud independent heritage
    - Texans call their state the "Lone Star State" in honor of this history
