## What Is Climate?

Remember the difference between weather and climate? **Weather** is what's happening outside right now—is it sunny, rainy, hot, or cold? **Climate** is the pattern of weather in a place over many years.

Think of it this way: weather is what you wear today, but climate is what clothes you keep in your closet all year long!

The United States has many different climates. Florida is warm and humid. Arizona is hot and dry. Alaska is cold most of the year. This variety is one of the things that makes America so interesting!

## Climate Zones of the United States

A **climate zone** is an area where the weather follows similar patterns year after year. Scientists group climates by temperature and precipitation (rain and snow). Let's explore the major climate zones found in the United States.

### Tropical Climate

A **tropical climate** is warm all year round with lots of rain. In the United States, only Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida have a truly tropical climate.

In tropical climates:

- Temperatures rarely go below 64°F (18°C)
- There is no real winter
- Rain falls throughout the year
- Palm trees, coconut palms, and tropical flowers grow well

!!! info "Fun Fact"
    Hawaii is the only US state where coffee grows commercially because it needs a warm, wet climate all year long!

### Arid Climate

An **arid climate** means very dry with little rainfall. Deserts have arid climates. In the United States, the Southwest has large areas with arid climate.

States with arid climates include:

- Arizona (the Sonoran Desert)
- Nevada (the Mojave Desert)
- Parts of California, New Mexico, Utah, and Texas

In arid climates:

- Less than 10 inches of rain falls each year
- Days are often very hot, but nights can be cold
- Plants like cactus store water to survive
- Animals are often active at night when it's cooler

### Mediterranean Climate

A **Mediterranean climate** has warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This climate is named after the Mediterranean Sea region in Europe, but California's coast has this climate too!

The Mediterranean climate in California is perfect for growing:

- Grapes for wine
- Olives
- Almonds
- Citrus fruits

!!! tip "Why California?"
    California's Mediterranean climate makes it America's top farming state. The warm, sunny summers help fruits and vegetables grow, and winter rains provide water.

### Humid Subtropical

A **humid subtropical** climate has hot, humid summers and mild winters. This climate covers most of the southeastern United States.

States with humid subtropical climate:

- Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana
- South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee
- Parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Virginia

In humid subtropical areas:

- Summers are hot and sticky
- Winters are mild but can have cold snaps
- Rain falls throughout the year
- Forests have a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees

### Humid Continental

A **humid continental** climate has four distinct seasons with hot summers and cold, snowy winters. This climate covers much of the northeastern and midwestern United States.

| Season | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Spring | Warming temperatures, rain, flowers blooming |
| Summer | Hot days, thunderstorms possible |
| Fall | Cooling temperatures, colorful leaves |
| Winter | Cold temperatures, snow, frozen lakes |

States with humid continental climate include New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and others in the Northeast and Midwest.

### Subarctic Climate

A **subarctic climate** has very long, cold winters and short, cool summers. In the United States, most of Alaska has a subarctic climate.

In subarctic regions:

- Winters can last 6-8 months
- Temperatures can drop to -40°F or colder
- Summers are short but have very long days (nearly 24 hours of sunlight!)
- The ground may be permanently frozen (permafrost)

## Temperature Patterns

**Temperature patterns** describe how hot or cold an area typically gets throughout the year. Temperature in the United States follows some general rules:

### Latitude Matters

Places farther north are generally colder than places farther south. That's why Minnesota is colder than Texas!

### Altitude Matters

Higher places are cooler than lower places. Mountains are cold even in southern states. For every 1,000 feet you go up, temperature drops about 3.5°F.

### Distance from Water Matters

Oceans help keep temperatures steady. Coastal areas don't get as hot in summer or as cold in winter as inland areas. San Francisco stays cool in summer while inland California gets very hot.

| Location | January Average | July Average | Why? |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| Miami, FL | 68°F | 83°F | Far south, near ocean |
| Phoenix, AZ | 55°F | 104°F | Desert, far from ocean |
| Minneapolis, MN | 16°F | 74°F | Far north, inland |
| San Francisco, CA | 51°F | 62°F | Pacific Ocean keeps it cool |
| Fairbanks, AK | -8°F | 62°F | Very far north |

## Rainfall Patterns

**Rainfall patterns** describe how much rain and when rain typically falls in different areas. The United States has very different rainfall patterns from place to place.

### The Wet Pacific Northwest

Washington and Oregon are famous for rain. Seattle gets rain on about 150 days per year! The Pacific Ocean provides moisture, and mountains force air up, creating rain.

### The Dry Southwest

The Southwest deserts get less than 10 inches of rain per year. Phoenix, Arizona gets only about 8 inches! That's why the landscape is dry and brown instead of green.

### The Wet Southeast

The Southeast gets plenty of rain—40 to 60 inches per year. Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico brings frequent rain showers and thunderstorms.

### The Great Plains

The middle of the country gets moderate rainfall, decreasing as you go west. Eastern Kansas might get 35 inches of rain, but western Kansas gets only 16 inches.

!!! note "Monsoons in America"
    The Southwest has a monsoon season in summer when storms bring heavy rain to the desert. This happens from July to September and can cause flash floods.

---

## Snowfall Regions

**Snowfall regions** are areas that regularly receive significant snow in winter. Not all cold places get lots of snow—it also takes moisture in the air.

### Lake Effect Snow

The Great Lakes create special weather called **lake effect snow**. Cold air blows across the relatively warm lakes, picks up moisture, and dumps heavy snow on nearby cities. Buffalo, New York and Cleveland, Ohio get lots of lake effect snow.

### Mountain Snow

Mountains across the western United States get heavy snowfall. The Sierra Nevada mountains in California and the Rocky Mountains can get 300-400 inches of snow per year! This snow is important because it provides water when it melts in spring.

### Snowy Cities

| City | Average Annual Snowfall | Why So Much? |
|------|------------------------|--------------|
| Syracuse, NY | 127 inches | Lake effect from Lake Ontario |
| Burlington, VT | 81 inches | Cold winter + moisture |
| Denver, CO | 57 inches | Mountain storms |
| Minneapolis, MN | 54 inches | Cold winter + storms |

## Extreme Weather

**Extreme weather** includes dangerous weather events that can cause damage and harm people. The United States experiences many types of extreme weather.

### Hurricanes

**Hurricanes** are huge spinning storms that form over warm ocean water. They bring:

- Very strong winds (74 mph or higher)
- Heavy rain that can cause flooding
- Storm surge (ocean water pushed onto land)

Hurricanes mainly affect:

- The Gulf Coast (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida)
- The Atlantic Coast (Florida up to the Carolinas and beyond)

Hurricane season runs from June through November. Hurricanes are given names like Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Harvey to help track them.

!!! warning "Hurricane Safety"
    People in hurricane areas should have emergency supplies ready and know evacuation routes. When officials say to evacuate, it's important to leave!

### Tornadoes

**Tornadoes** are violent spinning columns of air that touch the ground. They form during thunderstorms and can have winds over 300 mph—the strongest winds on Earth!

Tornadoes can happen almost anywhere, but they're most common in **"Tornado Alley"**:

- Texas
- Oklahoma
- Kansas
- Nebraska
- South Dakota

Most tornadoes happen in spring and early summer when warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from Canada.

**Instructional Rationale**: Understanding why tornadoes happen in specific areas helps students see the connection between geography, air masses, and weather patterns.
</details>

### Blizzards

**Blizzards** are severe winter storms with heavy snow, strong winds, and cold temperatures. During a blizzard, it's hard to see because snow blows through the air.

A storm is officially a blizzard when it has:

- Winds of 35 mph or more
- Falling or blowing snow that reduces visibility
- Lasts at least 3 hours

Blizzards are most common in:

- The Great Plains
- The Midwest
- The Northeast

### Droughts

A **drought** is a long period without enough rain or snow. Droughts can last months or even years. They cause problems like:

- Crop failures
- Water shortages
- Wildfires
- Dust storms

California, Texas, and the Great Plains have all experienced severe droughts. Droughts are a natural part of climate, but they can be made worse by overusing water resources.

## Coastlines and Climate

**Coastlines** are where land meets the ocean. The United States has about 12,000 miles of coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Gulf of Mexico.

Coastlines affect climate in important ways:

### Ocean Breezes

During the day, land heats up faster than water. Warm air over land rises, and cooler air from the ocean moves in. This creates refreshing sea breezes on hot summer days.

### Moderate Temperatures

The ocean doesn't heat up or cool down as fast as land. Coastal cities stay cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland cities at the same latitude.

### Fog

When warm air passes over cold ocean water, fog can form. San Francisco is famous for its fog, especially in summer when warm inland air meets the cold Pacific Ocean.

| Coast | Climate Feature | Example |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| Pacific Northwest | Rainy, mild | Seattle, WA |
| California Coast | Mediterranean, dry summers | San Diego, CA |
| Gulf Coast | Hot, humid, hurricanes | New Orleans, LA |
| Atlantic Northeast | Cold winters, nor'easters | Boston, MA |
| Atlantic Southeast | Humid subtropical | Miami, FL |

## How Climate Affects People

Climate affects almost everything about how people live:

1. **What clothes we wear** - Warm coats in Minnesota, shorts in Florida
2. **What houses look like** - Steep roofs for snow, air conditioning in the South
3. **What food grows** - Oranges in Florida, apples in Washington
4. **What activities we do** - Skiing in Colorado, surfing in California
5. **How much energy we use** - Heating in the North, cooling in the South

Understanding climate helps people prepare for what to expect throughout the year!

## Review Questions

??? question "What is the difference between weather and climate?"
    **Weather** is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular time and place—what's happening outside right now (sunny, rainy, hot, cold). **Climate** is the pattern of weather in a place over many years—what's typical for that location throughout the seasons.

??? question "Why does California's coast have a Mediterranean climate? What grows well there?"
    California's coast has a **Mediterranean climate** with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This is similar to the climate around the Mediterranean Sea. This climate is perfect for growing grapes (for wine), olives, almonds, and citrus fruits.

??? question "What is Tornado Alley, and why do so many tornadoes happen there?"
    **Tornado Alley** is a region in the central United States including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. So many tornadoes happen there because warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from Canada. When these air masses collide, they create the unstable conditions that spawn tornadoes.

??? question "How do the Great Lakes create 'lake effect snow'?"
    **Lake effect snow** happens when cold winter air blows across the relatively warmer Great Lakes. The air picks up moisture from the lakes and then dumps heavy snow on cities downwind of the lakes. That's why cities like Buffalo, NY and Cleveland, OH get so much snow.

??? question "What are four ways that climate affects how people live?"
    Climate affects people's lives in many ways, including:

    1. **Clothing** - People in cold climates need warm coats; people in hot climates wear lighter clothes
    2. **Housing** - Homes in snowy areas have steep roofs; hot areas need air conditioning
    3. **Food** - Different crops grow in different climates (oranges in Florida, apples in Washington)
    4. **Activities** - Climate determines sports and recreation (skiing in Colorado, surfing in Hawaii)
    5. **Energy use** - Northern states use more heating fuel; southern states use more electricity for cooling

??? question "Why do coastal cities have more moderate temperatures than inland cities?"
    Coastal cities have more moderate temperatures because the **ocean heats up and cools down more slowly than land**. In summer, the ocean stays cooler than the land, so ocean breezes keep coastal cities from getting too hot. In winter, the ocean stays warmer than the land, so coastal cities don't get as cold. This is why San Francisco stays cool in summer while inland California gets very hot.
