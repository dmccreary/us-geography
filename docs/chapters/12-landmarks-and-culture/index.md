## Airports and Ports: Gateways to America

### Airports

**Airports** are more than just places where planes land and take off. They're gateways that connect cities, regions, and countries. The busiest airports handle tens of millions of passengers each year!

| Airport | City | Passengers/Year | Importance |
|---------|------|-----------------|------------|
| Hartsfield-Jackson | Atlanta, GA | 90+ million | Busiest in the world |
| O'Hare | Chicago, IL | 80+ million | Major hub |
| Los Angeles | Los Angeles, CA | 75+ million | West Coast gateway |
| Dallas/Fort Worth | Dallas, TX | 70+ million | Central US hub |
| Denver | Denver, CO | 65+ million | Mountain region hub |

Major airports are important because they:

- Connect cities for business and tourism
- Provide jobs for thousands of workers
- Support trade by moving cargo
- Help emergency response efforts

### Ports

**Ports** are places where ships load and unload cargo. America's ports handle billions of dollars of goods each year.

Major US ports:

- **Los Angeles/Long Beach** - Largest port, handles goods from Asia
- **New York/New Jersey** - East Coast gateway
- **Houston** - Oil and chemical shipping
- **Savannah** - Fast-growing container port
- **Seattle/Tacoma** - Pacific Northwest trade

!!! info "Fun Fact"
    About 90% of everything you buy traveled on a ship at some point. Ports connect American consumers to products made around the world!

## National Parks: America's Best Idea

The United States was the first country to create **national parks**—protected areas of natural beauty preserved for everyone to enjoy. Today, the National Park System includes 63 national parks and hundreds of other protected areas.

### Why National Parks Matter

National parks:

- Protect wildlife and ecosystems
- Preserve natural wonders for future generations
- Provide places for recreation and learning
- Protect cultural and historical sites
- Support local economies through tourism

!!! tip "The National Park Service"
    The National Park Service was created in 1916 to protect and manage national parks. Park rangers work to preserve the parks while helping millions of visitors each year.

### Yellowstone National Park

**Yellowstone** was the world's first national park, established in 1872. It's located mostly in Wyoming, with parts in Montana and Idaho.

Yellowstone is famous for:

- **Old Faithful** - A geyser that erupts about every 90 minutes
- **Hot springs and geysers** - More than half the world's geysers are here!
- **Wildlife** - Bison, bears, wolves, elk, and more
- **Grand Prismatic Spring** - A colorful hot spring
- **Yellowstone Lake** - One of the largest high-altitude lakes in North America

Yellowstone sits on top of an ancient **supervolcano**. The geothermal features (geysers, hot springs) are powered by heat from magma deep underground.

### Grand Canyon National Park

The **Grand Canyon** in Arizona is one of Earth's most spectacular natural wonders. It's about 277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and over a mile deep!

What makes the Grand Canyon special?

- **Age**: The rock layers at the bottom are nearly 2 billion years old
- **Colors**: Different rock layers create bands of red, orange, brown, and purple
- **The Colorado River**: Carved the canyon over millions of years
- **Views**: Millions of visitors come to see the amazing views
- **Hiking**: Trails lead down into the canyon

### Yosemite National Park

**Yosemite** in California is known for its stunning granite cliffs, waterfalls, and giant sequoia trees.

Famous features of Yosemite:

- **Half Dome** - An iconic granite peak
- **El Capitan** - A massive rock face popular with climbers
- **Yosemite Falls** - One of the tallest waterfalls in North America
- **Giant sequoias** - Some of the largest trees on Earth
- **Yosemite Valley** - A beautiful glacial valley

### Great Smoky Mountains

The **Great Smoky Mountains** National Park straddles the border of Tennessee and North Carolina. It's the most visited national park in America!

Why is it so popular?

- **Accessibility**: Located near major population centers in the Southeast
- **Beauty**: Misty mountains covered with forests
- **Wildlife**: Black bears, deer, wild turkeys
- **History**: Historic cabins and buildings from pioneer days
- **Free admission**: No entrance fee (unlike most national parks)

The "smoky" name comes from the blue haze that often hangs over the mountains, created by moisture released by trees.

| Park | State(s) | Famous For | Visitors/Year |
|------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Great Smoky Mountains | TN, NC | Misty mountains, wildlife | 12+ million |
| Grand Canyon | AZ | Deep colorful canyon | 6+ million |

    **Conservation** means protecting natural resources and the environment for future generations.

    It's important because:

    1. **Climate change**: People are developing renewable energy (solar, wind) and electric vehicles to reduce emissions

    2. **Water pollution**: The Clean Water Act sets standards for water quality, and communities are working to clean up rivers and lakes

    3. **Habitat loss**: National parks, wildlife refuges, and conservation programs protect land for wildlife
