## Introduction to Economic Geography

**Economic geography** studies how geography affects where people work and what they produce. Different parts of the United States are good for different kinds of work because of climate, soil, natural resources, and location.

Think about it: Why do farmers grow oranges in Florida but not in Minnesota? Why are oil wells in Texas but not in Vermont? Why are most technology companies in California? The answers all connect to geography!

## Agriculture: America's Farms

**Agriculture** means farming—growing crops and raising animals for food. The United States is one of the world's most productive farming nations, and different regions specialize in different products.

### Farming Regions

The United States has several major **farming regions**, each specializing in particular crops based on climate and soil:

| Region | Location | Main Crops/Products | Why There? |
|--------|----------|---------------------|------------|
| Corn Belt | Midwest | Corn, soybeans | Rich soil, warm summers |
| Wheat Belt | Great Plains | Wheat | Dry climate, flat land |
| Cotton Belt | South | Cotton | Long growing season |
| Dairy Belt | Northeast, Upper Midwest | Milk, cheese | Cool climate, good pasture |
| Fruit Belt | California, Florida | Fruits, vegetables | Warm climate, irrigation |

### The Corn Belt

The **Corn Belt** stretches across the Midwest, including Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and parts of surrounding states.

Why is corn grown here?

- **Rich, black soil** (some of the best in the world!)
- **Warm summers** with enough rain
- **Flat land** perfect for large farms
- **Long history** of corn farming

!!! info "Corn Facts"
    - Iowa produces more corn than any other state
    - Corn is used for food, animal feed, ethanol fuel, and many products
    - One bushel of corn can make 33 pounds of sweetener or 2.8 gallons of ethanol!

### The Wheat Belt

The **Wheat Belt** covers the Great Plains from Texas to Montana. This region is drier than the Corn Belt but perfect for wheat.

States in the Wheat Belt:

- Kansas (produces the most wheat)
- North Dakota
- Montana
- Oklahoma
- Texas Panhandle

Wheat needs less water than corn, so it grows well in the semi-arid Great Plains.

### The Cotton Belt

The **Cotton Belt** stretches across the South, from Texas to the Carolinas. Cotton needs:

- A long, hot growing season
- Plenty of sunshine
- Moderate rainfall

Today, Texas grows more cotton than any other state.

### Dairy Farming

**Dairy farming** produces milk, cheese, butter, and other dairy products. Wisconsin is called "America's Dairyland" and produces more cheese than any other state.

Dairy farms are found in:

- Wisconsin and Minnesota
- New York and Pennsylvania
- California (actually produces the most milk!)

### Ranching

**Ranching** means raising cattle, sheep, or other livestock on large areas of land. Ranches are common in the West where:

- Land is too dry for crops
- There's lots of open range
- Cattle can graze on grasses

Texas has more cattle than any other state!

## Natural Resources

**Natural resources** are materials from nature that people use. The United States is rich in many natural resources, but they're not spread evenly across the country.

### Mining

**Mining** extracts minerals and metals from the earth. Important mining in the US includes:

| Resource | Main States | Uses |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Coal | Wyoming, West Virginia | Electricity, steel |
| Iron ore | Minnesota, Michigan | Steel |
| Copper | Arizona, Utah | Wiring, electronics |
| Gold | Nevada, Alaska | Jewelry, electronics |

### Oil and Gas

**Oil and gas** are fossil fuels found underground. The United States is one of the world's largest oil producers.

Top oil-producing states:

1. Texas (produces the most)
2. New Mexico
3. North Dakota
4. Alaska
5. Colorado

The **Gulf of Mexico** is also a major source of offshore oil drilling.

!!! warning "Fossil Fuels and the Environment"
    Burning oil, gas, and coal produces energy but also creates pollution and contributes to climate change. Many people are working to develop cleaner energy sources like solar and wind power.

### Forestry

**Forestry** is the industry of growing and harvesting trees for wood and paper products.

Major forestry regions:

- **Pacific Northwest** (Oregon, Washington) - Giant evergreen forests
- **Southeast** (Georgia, Alabama) - Fast-growing pine trees
- **Northern forests** (Minnesota, Maine) - Mixed hardwood and softwood

### Fishing Industry

The **fishing industry** harvests fish and seafood from oceans, lakes, and rivers.

Major fishing areas:

- **Alaska** - Salmon, crab, pollock (the most seafood of any state)
- **New England** - Lobster, cod, clams
- **Gulf Coast** - Shrimp, oysters
- **Pacific Northwest** - Salmon, tuna

## Manufacturing and Technology

### Manufacturing

**Manufacturing** means making products in factories. The United States was once the world's manufacturing leader, especially in:

- **Cars**: Detroit, Michigan ("Motor City")
- **Steel**: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Gary, Indiana
- **Aircraft**: Seattle, Washington (Boeing)
- **Food processing**: Throughout the Midwest

Today, many manufacturing jobs have moved to other countries, but the US still makes aerospace products, machinery, and advanced electronics.

### Technology Hubs

**Technology hubs** are places where technology companies cluster together.

### Silicon Valley

**Silicon Valley** in California is the world's most famous technology hub. Located south of San Francisco, it's home to:

- Apple
- Google
- Meta (Facebook)
- Many startups and tech companies

Why did Silicon Valley develop here?

- Stanford University provided talent and research
- Good weather attracted workers
- Early computer companies started here
- Success attracted more companies

Other technology hubs include:

| City | Specialty |
|------|-----------|
| Seattle, WA | Software (Microsoft, Amazon) |
| Austin, TX | Technology, gaming |
| Boston, MA | Biotech, robotics |
| Raleigh, NC | Research Triangle |

## Transportation Networks

**Transportation** is how people and goods move from place to place. The United States has an extensive network of highways, railroads, airports, and ports.

### Interstate Highways

The **Interstate Highway System** is a network of high-speed roads connecting all major cities. Started in 1956, it now has over 48,000 miles of roads.

How interstate numbers work:

- **Odd numbers** (I-5, I-95) run north-south
- **Even numbers** (I-10, I-90) run east-west
- **Low numbers** are in the south and west
- **High numbers** are in the north and east

Major interstate highways:

| Interstate | Route | Connects |
|------------|-------|----------|
| I-95 | North-South | Maine to Florida (East Coast) |
| I-10 | East-West | California to Florida (South) |
| I-90 | East-West | Seattle to Boston (North) |
| I-5 | North-South | Canada to Mexico (West Coast) |

!!! tip "Reading Highway Signs"
    Interstate signs are shaped like shields. Blue and red signs mean interstate highways. Green signs give directions and distances.

### Railroads

**Railroads** were the first way to move goods and people across long distances. Today, railroads mostly carry freight (goods), not passengers.

Railroads transport:

- Coal from mines
- Grain from farms
- Cars from factories
- Containers from ports

**Amtrak** is the passenger railroad, but most Americans travel by car or plane instead.

## Review Questions

??? question "What is the Corn Belt, and why does corn grow well there?"
    The **Corn Belt** is a farming region in the Midwest that includes Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, and surrounding states. Corn grows well there because:

    - The soil is **rich and black**, some of the best farmland in the world
    - Summers are **warm** with enough rain
    - The land is **flat**, making it easy to farm with large machinery
    - There's a **long tradition** of corn farming with experienced farmers

??? question "Name three natural resources and which states produce them."
    Three natural resources and where they're produced:

    1. **Oil**: Texas (the top producer), New Mexico, North Dakota, Alaska
    2. **Coal**: Wyoming (most coal), West Virginia
    3. **Iron ore**: Minnesota, Michigan

    Other examples include copper (Arizona, Utah), gold (Nevada, Alaska), and timber (Oregon, Washington, Georgia).

??? question "What is Silicon Valley, and why did it become a technology center?"
    **Silicon Valley** is a region in California, south of San Francisco, that's home to many of the world's largest technology companies (Apple, Google, Meta).

    It became a technology center because:

    - **Stanford University** provided educated workers and research
    - The **pleasant weather** attracted talented people
    - **Early computer companies** started there
    - **Success attracted more companies** in a cycle of growth

??? question "How does the interstate highway numbering system work?"
    Interstate highway numbers follow a pattern:

    - **Odd numbers** (I-5, I-95) run **north-south**
    - **Even numbers** (I-10, I-90) run **east-west**
    - **Low numbers** are in the **south and west**
    - **High numbers** are in the **north and east**

    For example, I-10 runs east-west across the South, while I-95 runs north-south along the East Coast.

??? question "Why do different regions of the US specialize in different types of farming?"
    Regions specialize in different farming because of **geography**:

    - **Climate** determines what can grow (oranges need warmth, wheat tolerates cold)
    - **Rainfall** matters (corn needs more water than wheat)
    - **Soil type** affects crops (the Midwest has rich, black soil)
    - **Terrain** helps (flat land is easier to farm than mountains)
    - **Growing season length** limits options (cotton needs long, hot summers)

??? question "Name two ways that transportation networks help the economy."
    Transportation networks help the economy by:

    1. **Moving goods**: Trucks carry products from factories to stores, trains carry grain from farms to ports, ships carry products to other countries

    2. **Connecting markets**: Farmers can sell crops to distant cities, manufacturers can ship to customers nationwide, businesses can reach customers everywhere

    3. **Creating jobs**: Truck drivers, railroad workers, pilots, and dock workers all have jobs because of transportation

    4. **Enabling trade**: Ports connect the US to world markets, highways connect states for domestic trade
