## Introduction to the Heartland

When people talk about the "heartland" of America, they mean the Midwest. This region is in the middle of the country, far from either coast. It's known for farms, friendly people, and flat plains that stretch for miles.

In this chapter, we'll also explore some Southern states and begin our journey to the Southwest—regions with very different landscapes and cultures from the Midwest.

## The Midwest Region

The **Midwest Region** is located in the north-central part of the United States. It's sometimes called "America's Breadbasket" because so much of the nation's food is grown here.

### What Makes the Midwest Special?

- **Agriculture**: Corn, wheat, and soybeans grow in huge quantities
- **Flat land**: The Great Plains are perfect for farming
- **Great Lakes**: Four of the five Great Lakes border Midwest states
- **Rivers**: The Mississippi and Missouri Rivers flow through the region
- **Industry**: Manufacturing and food processing are important

### Great Lakes States

The **Great Lakes States** are Midwest states that border the Great Lakes:

- Michigan
- Illinois (borders Lake Michigan)
- Indiana (borders Lake Michigan)
- Minnesota (borders Lake Superior)

Let's explore some important Midwest states!

- An important center for business and culture

But Illinois isn't just Chicago! Central and southern Illinois have rich farmland that produces corn and soybeans.

    Chicago is called "The Windy City." Some say it's because of the wind from Lake Michigan. Others say it's because politicians there talked a lot!

- The Indianapolis 500 car race
- Basketball (it's very popular here!)
