## Introduction to the American West

The **West Region** is the largest part of the United States. It stretches from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, and includes Alaska far to the north and Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

The West is known for:

- **Dramatic landscapes**: Mountains, deserts, canyons, and coastlines
- **Wide open spaces**: Some western states have more land than people!
- **Natural wonders**: National parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon
- **Diverse climates**: From tropical Hawaii to arctic Alaska

## The Mountain States

The **Mountain States** are named for the Rocky Mountains, which run through this region like a giant spine. These states have high elevations, cold winters in the mountains, and spectacular scenery.

- Outdoor activities like hiking and camping

!!! info "Mile High City"

- Big Sky Country (wide open spaces and beautiful skies)
- Glacier National Park
- Cattle ranching
- Being the 4th largest state but having fewer than 1.2 million people

Idaho also has:

- Wilderness areas and national forests

<summary>Mountain States Interactive Map

**Type**: microsim

**Learning Objective**: Students will identify (L1) Mountain states and locate (L1) the Rocky Mountains running through the region.

**Bloom Level**: Remember

**Bloom Verbs**: identify, locate, name

</summary>

**MicroSim Description**: An interactive map of the Mountain states showing the Rocky Mountains as a 3D elevation feature. Students click on each state to see its capital, key features, and famous landmarks. The map shows elevation changes with shading—higher areas appear darker. National parks are marked with icons.

<summary>Alaska and Hawaii Interactive Map

**Type**: microsim

**Learning Objective**: Students will compare (L4) the size and location of Alaska and Hawaii to the lower 48 states and identify (L1) key features of each state.

**Bloom Level**: Analyze

**Bloom Verbs**: compare, identify, contrast

</summary>

**MicroSim Description**: An interactive display showing Alaska and Hawaii at their correct scale compared to the lower 48 states. Students can overlay Alaska onto the lower 48 to see how large it really is. For Hawaii, students can explore each island and learn about volcanoes, beaches, and cities. The simulation shows climate zones, daylight hours by season, and key geographic features.

**UI Complexity**: Medium - Scale comparison tools with clickable regions and seasonal information

**Instructional Rationale**: Understanding the true scale of Alaska and Hawaii's unique island geography helps students appreciate how different these states are from the contiguous 48 states.

## Review Questions
