Climate is the pattern of weather in a place over many years\u2014what's typical for that location throughout the seasons.</p> Why does California's coast have a Mediterranean climate? What grows well there? <p>California's coast has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This is similar to the climate around the Mediterranean Sea. This climate is perfect for growing grapes (for wine), olives, almonds, and citrus fruits.</p> What is Tornado Alley, and why do so many tornadoes happen there? <p>Tornado Alley is a region in the central United States including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. So many tornadoes happen there because warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from Canada. When these air masses collide, they create the unstable conditions that spawn tornadoes.</p> How do the Great Lakes create 'lake effect snow'? <p>Lake effect snow happens when cold winter air blows across the relatively warmer Great Lakes. The air picks up moisture from the lakes and then dumps heavy snow on cities downwind of the lakes. That's why cities like Buffalo, NY and Cleveland, OH get so much snow.</p> What are four ways that climate affects how people live? <p>Climate affects people's lives in many ways, including:</p> <ol> <li>Clothing - People in cold climates need warm coats; people in hot climates wear lighter clothes</li> <li>Housing - Homes in snowy areas have steep roofs; hot areas need air conditioning</li> <li>Food - Different crops grow in different climates (oranges in Florida, apples in Washington)</li> <li>Activities - Climate determines sports and recreation (skiing in Colorado, surfing in Hawaii)</li> <li>Energy use - Northern states use more heating fuel; southern states use more electricity for cooling</li> </ol> Why do coastal cities have more moderate temperatures than inland cities? <p>Coastal cities have more moderate temperatures because the ocean heats up and cools down more slowly than land. In summer, the ocean stays cooler than the land, so ocean breezes keep coastal cities from getting too hot. In winter, the ocean stays warmer than the land, so coastal cities don't get as cold. This is why San Francisco stays cool in summer while inland California gets very hot.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/05-climate-and-weather/quiz/","title":"Quiz: Climate and Weather Patterns","text":"<p>Test your understanding of climate zones and weather patterns with these questions.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/05-climate-and-weather/quiz/#1-what-is-the-main-difference-between-weather-and-climate","title":"1.
